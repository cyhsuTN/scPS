\title{DEA Using GEE for Paired-Group Comparison}
\usage{
geeDEA.BA(counts.test, cell.info, hf = NULL, BCC = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts.test}{Count matrix of tested genes.}

\item{cell.info}{Cell information (patients' id and x1 are required).}

\item{hf}{A curve showing the relationship between gene means and gene deviations.
The default = NULL, assuming there is no relationship between
gene means and gene deviations, and gene variances of group 1 are the same as
those of group 2.}

\item{BCC}{Bias covariance correction at small sample sizes. = 0, no correction;
= 1 (Default), t distribution with a degree of freedom = (total size) - 2; = 2,
t distribution and MD's bias covariance correction.}
}
\description{
A function to perform differential expression analysis using GEE
for paired-group comparison.
